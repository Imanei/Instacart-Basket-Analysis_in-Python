# Instacart Basket Analysis in Python
This project focuses on data wrangling and analysis of Instacart datasets using Python. The aim was to produce a report that outlines my analysis process, results, and strategic recommendations based on key business questions provided by Instacart.

## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store operating through a mobile app. While their sales performance is strong, they seek deeper insights into their sales patterns. My task was to conduct an initial exploratory data analysis to extract meaningful insights and propose strategies for better customer segmentation, based on specific criteria.

## Key Business Questions
The project was designed to address the following key questions from the Instacart team:

● Busiest Days & Times: When are the peak days and hours for orders? This will help the sales team optimize ad scheduling during quieter times.

● Spending Patterns: Are there specific times when customers spend more? This could guide product advertisement strategies for those peak spending times.

● Price Ranges: Instacart has a diverse range of product prices. Can we create simpler pricing segments to help guide marketing and sales efforts?

● Product Popularity: Which product categories or departments receive the most orders? Understanding this will help focus promotional efforts.

● Customer Segmentation & Behavior: What insights can we gather about different types of customers and their behaviors? Specifically:

1. What’s the distribution of customer loyalty—how frequently do customers return to shop at Instacart?
2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on loyalty status?
3. Do customer ordering behaviors vary by region?
4. How do age and family status influence ordering patterns?
5. Can we classify customers based on demographics like age, income, family status, or product preferences?
6. What patterns can we find in terms of order frequency, order value, and product preferences across different customer profiles?

## Datasets Used
The analysis was performed using the following datasets:

● orders ● orders_products_prior ● products ● customers ● departments

Note: The customer dataset and the prices column were added to the original data as part of a learning project in the CareerFoundry course.

## Tools & Libraries
The analysis was conducted using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis ● NumPy: Mathematical operations ● Seaborn: Data visualization ● Matplotlib: Data visualization ● SciPy: Statistical analysis ● Warnings: Suppressing unnecessary warnings

## Folder Structure
The project files are organized into the following folders:

1. Project Management: Includes the project brief and data dictionary.
2. Data: Contains two subfolders—Original Data and Prepared Data. These hold the original datasets and the cleaned datasets used for analysis, respectively. (Note: Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size constraints.)
3. Scripts: Jupyter notebooks with the Python code for data analysis.
4. Analysis: Contains visualizations used to derive and present insights.
5. Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.
